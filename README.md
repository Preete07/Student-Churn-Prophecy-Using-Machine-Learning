Abstract :

Dropout is one of the critical issues faced by educational institutions in terms of both academic performance and institutional efficiency. The project, Student Churn Prophecy Using Machine Learning, aims at predicting the likelihood of dropout using machine learning algorithms. A broad range of student data, such as academic performance, attendance records, demographic details, and engagement levels, is processed and analyzed to identify key patterns and trends. This system generates predictive models that forecast at-risk students and allows timely intervention strategies. The approach enhances student retention and overall educational outcomes of institutions by adopting this methodology. 
Keywords: Student dropout, machine learning, predictive analysis, academic performance, student retention

Problem statement:

Student dropout rates present a significant challenge in educational institutions, hindering both academic success and institutional stability. Identifying students at risk of dropping out and understanding the underlying factors contributing to this attrition is critical for enabling timely interventions. However, the complexity of analyzing large datasets, including academic performance, attendance records, and demographic information, makes it difficult to predict which students are at risk.

Conclusion :

The complete and functional Student Churn Prophecy Using Machine Learning project successfully predicts dropping out based on parameters such as academic performance, attendance, study habits, and engagement levels. They provided evidence showing that students with low CGPA and those with a very high count of Backlogs in a semester along with students with poor attendance are most probable to drop out. The students at risk can easily be identified by employing machine learning, thereby opening up avenues for appropriate intervention strategies to improve the retention rate. This predictive model is a very useful instrument in improving student success and academic planning.
